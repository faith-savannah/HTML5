                    <h2>Chapter One: A brief history of Markup</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>HyperText Markup Language(HTML) was the brainchild of Sir Tim Berners-Lee</li> 
                            <br/>   
                            <li>The first official specification was <strong>HTML 2.0,</strong> published by the IETF.Thus there was never HTML 1.0 </li>
                            <br/>
                            <li>The role of the IETF was superceded by the W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium, where subsequent iterations of the HTML standard have been published at <a href="http://www.w3.org">http://www.w3.org</a>.</li>  
                            <br/>                      
                            <li>After subsequent revisions from HTML 2.0 to HTML 4.01, the next revision bore XHTML 1.0</li>
                            <br/>                        
                            <li>eXtreem HTML 1.0/XHTML 1.0 was different from HTML in the syntax only whereby XHTML required a stricter adherance to the rules of XML markup language.</li>
                            <br/>
                            <li>WHATWG stands for WebHypertext Application Technology Working Group.It propagated the idea of extending HTML to allow the creation of web applications, opposed to the path the W3C took of XHTML 2.0 which was backward incorpartible.</li> 
                            <br/>                 
                            <li>HTML5 is a specification that merged two specifications: Web Forms 2.0 and Web Apps 1.0. Both specifications were from the WHATWG and were intended to extend HTML</li>  
                            <br/>                      
                            <li></li>

                            <li></li>                        
                            <li></li>
